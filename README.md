# Welcome to ScaleUp ðŸ‘‹   

In this project, I have used Async Storage to store email and password on my device.

Why Async Storage?   
âœ… It allows storing a small amount of data in a key-value pair.  
âœ… It is a good choice for storing small, non-sensitive data.  
âœ… It provides asynchronous, unencrypted, and persistent key-value storage for React Native apps.
